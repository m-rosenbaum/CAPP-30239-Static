				Among U.S. benefits programs, researchers have spent a lot of time trying to understand why eligible recipients don't actually take up the benefits they are entitled to. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w10488">Low take-up is severe</a> for many programs: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/uisup.nr0.htm">26 percent</a> of potential recipients took up unemployment insurance (UI) in 2022. This is not a new fact. Since the early 2000s, recipiency rates, what they call who receives benefits of those who are unemployed, has not changed all that much.

				Why is this? Research has provided a lot of answers to plausible reasons why individuals don't take up benefits - people may not be aware they are eligible, applications are hard to complete, there's stigma against taking government handouts, risk of paying back benefits if you mistakenly or purposefully claimed benefits you weren't entitled to can be severe. All of this and more contributes. But even just figuring out who is entitled, granted as a right by the law, is a complicated question.

				Some history on these programs can be helpful. Take unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance was established <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-unemployment-insurance">by the 1935 Social Security Act</a>. Although UI is authorized by the federal government, each state administers a separate UI program through a state workforce agency. Unemployment insurance was originally established to partially replace income for people who lose their jobs due to changes in the economy, not their own fault. Over the past century, it has grown and changed. Some core features have stayed the same though: the program is funded by taxes on employers and paid for by the federal government; the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) oversees these programs and provides administrative funding to states to administer it. In each state, individual recipients of UI must meet eligibility criteria defined by each state workforce agency. All recipients (i) must have earned a sufficient income from an eligible employer in a specific time period and (ii) have become involuntarily unemployed through no fault of their own. For example, <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/uilawcompar/2023/complete.pdf">Nevada's monetary eligibility requirements</a> are described as "1.5 [times the] high-quarter wages in the base period and $400 in the high quarter [or] of wages in 3 of the 4 quarters in the base period and $400 in the high quarter [of the base year]."
